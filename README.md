# GTA SannyBuilder script sources

Collection of the SannyBuilder source files used in all of the projects I've ever developed. General requirement to compile any of these: use SannyBuilder 3

## GTA: Sindacco Chronicles

Link: https://barcode-studia.ru/mods/sindacco-chronicles/

Requires modified LCSSCM.ini to compile. Add these opcodes to the file:

* 0679=3,change_radar_section_color %1d% %2d% %3d%
* 067A=1,test_cheat %1s%
* 067B=1,vehicle_cheat %1d%
* 067C=1,reset_player_stamina %1d%
* 067F=1,change_txd %1s%

## GTA: Forelli Redemption - Reissued

Link: https://barcode-studia.ru/mods/fr-reissued/

Not released yet, so there are no sources. But they should be there somewhere around late 2024 ðŸ‘€

## CLEO scripts (CLEO 3+ is required)

1. Nextbots-SA

Tries to copy the behaviour of the Source games nextbots. Requested by willkozz.

2. ShortRangeBlips-III

Link: https://libertycity.ru/files/gta-3/182381-metki-oruzhija-perekraski-i-bomby-na.html

Brings the short range blips from later GTA games to GTA 3 without using any external opcodes or memory edits, so this code can be used on consoles without any edits too.
